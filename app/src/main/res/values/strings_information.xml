        \n <strong>What do the hiker shaped symbols mean?</strong>
        \n The hiker images located on the bottom left are indicators of the difficulty of the hike. 1 means the hike is
        easily accessible for most conditions, 2 stars means that some experience and physical conditioning is required
        Three stars indicate a trail that requires good physical condition as well as proper gear. Difficulty
        is based off of how well maintained the trails are, the natural terrain and the length of the route.
