        \n<b>What do the hiker shaped symbols mean?</b>
        \nThe hiker images located on the bottom left are indicators of the difficulty of the hike.
        \n<b>•</b> 1 icon means the hike is easily accessible for most conditions
        \n<b>•</b> 2 icons means that some experience and physical conditioning is required
        \n<b>•</b> 3 icons indicate a trail that requires good physical condition as well as proper gear.
        \nDifficulty is based off of how well maintained the trails are, the natural terrain and the length of the route.
