                \n\n\tThe Lanikai Pillboxes, or Kaiwa Ridge Trail is a short but steep uphill hike that leads you to an old military pillbox.
                \n\t\tThe trail is 1.8 miles and can be quite rocky at points, there are no guardrails so it can be difficult for children.

                \n\t\tThe hike can be quite popular so be prepared to meet other people on the trail.

                \n\t\tThe Maunawili Falls is a valley hike, taking you through the forest and across streams to reach a small 20ft waterfall.
                \n\t\tThe hike is 2.5 miles but has both uphill and downhill sections.
                \n\t\tAfter periods of rain the hike can be extremely muddy and slippery so pay attention to weather forecasts.
                \n\t\tYou can swim in the pool and even jump off the top of the waterfall, but be safe!

        <item>Hike Difficulty: Hard

                \n\n\tThe Stairway to Heaven or Haiku Stairs is one of the most well known hikes on Oahu.
                \n\t\tIt is a staircase with 3922 steps built in 1942 that ascends Ko\'olau Mountain.
                \n\t\tThe main entrance to this hike has been blocked due to damage to the stairs, going this route is currently ILLEGAL and has a $1000 fine.
                \n\t\tTo do this hike legally you must go along Moanalua Trail until you reach the top of the ridge, this will put you at the top of the stairway from the back. Do not descend the stairway as this will take you to the illegal entrance, return back down the mountain using the same Moanalua trail.
                \n\t\tIf done during sunrise or sunset this hike has some of the most beautiful views Oahu has to offer.
